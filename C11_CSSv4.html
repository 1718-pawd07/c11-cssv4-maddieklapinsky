				<p>As of right now no single person has been credited with the creation of ice cream. However many believe that it dates back as far as the second century B.C. Biblical writings and other historical texts show that snow was flavored with honey nectar, fruits, and juices. Some believe however that ice cream comes from the recipe of sherbert that Marco Polo brought back to Italy after his travels. </p>
				<p>The first official record of ice cream in the United States dates back to 1744. Records show that George Washington and Thomas Jefferson enjoyed this delicious dessert. During this time until the 1800s ice cream was only used as a dessert for the wealthy. </p>
				<p>Ice cream has led to the creation of many new desserts. One of these is the ice cream sundae. The ice cream sunday was created after people felt guilty for eating ice cream on Sundays and the name was later changed to sundae. </p>
